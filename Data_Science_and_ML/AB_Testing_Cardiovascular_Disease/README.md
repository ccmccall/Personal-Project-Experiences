Cardiovascular Disease Hypothesis Test (Python):

Heart disease is one of the major causes of death in the world. Throughout this project, I investigated the relationship between chlorestoral and heart disease using data from the Framingham Dataset. The conclusion of the AB Test found the correlation between heart disease likelihood and high chlorestoral to be statistically significant, by a 1% signficance rate. Despite this very strong correlation, the project was not able to conclude causation as the data from the study was conducted with participants over multiple decades.
