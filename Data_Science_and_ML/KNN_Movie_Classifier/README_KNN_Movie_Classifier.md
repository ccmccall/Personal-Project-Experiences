KNN Movie Classifier (Python):

This project applies a K Nearest Neighbor Classifier to predict which genre a movie is based on the vocabulary used within the movie script. This project required string transformation, generating proportions of each vocabulary word per movie, and then manually choosing the number of features and which features to be applied.
