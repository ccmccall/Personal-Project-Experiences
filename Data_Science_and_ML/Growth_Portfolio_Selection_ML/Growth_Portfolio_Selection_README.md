Growth Portfolio Selection ML (R):

This project applies Linear Regression to predict and recommend a portfolio of 12 stocks that have the highest likelihood of high growth (+30% per year). The Regression file contains the process of optimizing the linear regression model through multiple iterations, and the Recommendataions File contains the finalized recommendation from this optimized model process.
