Buzzfeed Affiliate Action Predictor (Python):

The Affiliate Action Predictor is Commerce Data ML tool I created to aid product rankings for User Personalization APIs.
It predicts a user's likelihood of whether or not they will click on an affiliate link as their next action, with 83% accuracy. Through the internship, I optimized four models in total: Random Forest, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble Methods.
I've provided a pdf of the Model Comparison analysis, as the code is Buzzfeed property.
